1.
Initialize student_counter to 1
Initialize total to 0
while student_counter <= 10:
	Input the next score
	Add score to the total
	student_counter += 1
endWhile

Set class average to be the total divided by 10

2.
Initialize the passes to 0
Initialize the failures to 0
Initialize student_counter to 1
while student_counter <= 10:
	Input the next score
	if score >= 50:
		add 1 to passes
	else:
		add 1 to failures
	add one to student_counter
endWhile

for i in range(1,21):
	if (i%3 == 0 and i%5 ==0):
		print("FizzBuzz")
	elif i%3==0:
		print("Fizz")
	elif i%5==0:
		print("Buzz")
	else:
		print(i)

Pseudocode:

FOR num -> 1 to 20
	IF num MOD 15 == 0
		PRINT "FizzBuzz"
