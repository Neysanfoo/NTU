/*
Memoization Recipe
1. Make it work
    - Visualize the problem as a tree
    - Implement the tree using recursion (think of leaves as base case)
    - Test it

2. Make it efficient
    - Add a memo object (arrays in C, dicts in higher languages)
    - Add a base case to return memo values
    - Store return values into the memo
